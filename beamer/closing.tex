  Most large projects have so-called 'Coding Standards'.

  These Standards explain how code on this project should be written.
  Amongst the things typically included in Coding Standards are:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Naming Conventions for Variables and Procedures
    \item Indentation Guidelines
    \item Comments and Documentation Guidelines
  \end{itemize}

  If you want to contribute to a major project, you need to follow these Coding Standards if you want to contribute.
